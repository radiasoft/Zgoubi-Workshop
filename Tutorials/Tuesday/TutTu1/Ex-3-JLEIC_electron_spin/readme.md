third tutorial

examine the JLEIC electron ring lattice.
turn on spin tracking and track for one turn, watching spin evolution around ring.
consider spin transfer matrices and spin tune.
compute invariant spin direction around ring and plot.
turn on synchrotron radiation and examine spin diffusion for a distribution of electrons.
