# Third tutorial: spin tracking in JLEIC

## Exercise 3a: 
Calculate the linear parameters in the JLEIC electron collider ring lattice and plot twiss functions around the ring. 
Global parameters also can be found in .res file. Note that SRLOSS and CAVITE are turned off.

## Exercise 3b:
Watch spin components at the different positions around the ring. Observe how the spin rotates across the spin rotator. 
Note again SRLOSS and CAVITE are off. Introduce vertical misalignments of quadrupoles, using FIT routine to find invariant 
spin field on the closed orbit.

## Exercise 3c:
Turn on SRLOSS and include CAVITE, adjusting spin tune using zero length spin rotator “SPINR” to be away from the zero 
integer resonance by 0.01. Perform one particle spin tracking with initial spin conditions aligned along the invariant 
spin field direction. Track for several hundred turns and observe spin dynamics. Now further adjust spin tune to be on 
the synchrotron tune ~0.027. Track single particle again and observe spin dynamics.
