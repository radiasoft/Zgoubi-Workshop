2nd exercise.

consider the ESRF lattice (rather old version), with dipoles, quadrupoles, sextupoles and RF cavity.
compute and examine the Twiss parameters.
create a random initial bunch of electrons and track these through the machine several damping times.
calculate damping time and eqilibrium emittance and compare that to the theoretical expectations.
