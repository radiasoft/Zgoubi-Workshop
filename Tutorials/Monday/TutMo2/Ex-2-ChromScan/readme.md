## Instructions

In this second exercise, we explore the numerical computation of
chromaticity. In the process, you will learn about and exercise two
very important Zgoubi keywords: `FIT` and `REBELOTE`.

For details about the numerical computation of chromaticity given in
this tutorial, see
[Dragtâ€™s 1982 paper](https://cds.cern.ch/record/890994/files/p205.pdf).
