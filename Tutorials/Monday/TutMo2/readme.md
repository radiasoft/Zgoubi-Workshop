# Tutorial TutMo2

## Dan T. Abell and Kiel Hock

This directory contains all Zgoubi input files and supporting material
for tutorial TutMo2. The exercises in this tutorial all center around 
the Los Alamos Proton Storage Ring (PSR). The benefits of basing our
exercises on this machine include the following:

1. The PSR has a simple ten-cell lattice that is both readily comprehended
   and easily input into Zgoubi.
1. There is an excellent [paper by Alex Dragt](https://cds.cern.ch/record/890994/files/p205.pdf)
   that describes not only the lattice, but also a useful numerical
   computation of chromaticity for that machine.

If you are attending the Zgoubi Workshop (and even if you aren’t!),
you are encouraged to read, or at least skim, Dragt’s paper.
