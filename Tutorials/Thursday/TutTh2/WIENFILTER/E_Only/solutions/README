Remove the "solutions" folder from jupyter


parallelPlates_withFringes.res, which is just parallelPlates.res with frine field added, is completely crazy, see gnuplot_trajectory.eps

to be debugged !

Bugs:

the plot of E(X) gives E=0.001MV/m instead of 1MV/m

Y from tracking does not agree with solution/parameters.ppt
