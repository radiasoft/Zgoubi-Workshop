[This paper](http://inspirehep.net/record/739070/) documents the 150 MeV radial sector scaling FFAG ring developped at KEK in the early 2000s, and implemented as the proton driver for the ADS-Reactor installation at KUNST.

[This paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016890020500923X) documents the zgoubi technique to simulate a 3-dipole or 5-dipole radial scaling FFAG magnet, and applies this technique to the KEK ring.
